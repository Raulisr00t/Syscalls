# Windows Syscalls Repository

This repository offers a detailed list of Windows syscall (System Service Number - SSN) mappings, associating syscall numbers with their corresponding function names across different Windows versions. It includes tools for extracting and analyzing syscall information directly from `ntdll.dll`, useful for reverse engineering, security research, and low-level system development.

## Features

- Windows syscall numbers and function mappings
- Tools for extracting syscalls from Windows DLLs
- Cross-version syscall analysis
- Support for security research and kernel-level development

## Usage

Clone the repository and explore the tools/scripts for extracting and analyzing syscall information:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Raulisr00t/Syscalls.git
```

## Contributions

Contributions for additional syscall mappings or version updates are welcome. Please submit pull requests or open an issue for any enhancements or bugs.
